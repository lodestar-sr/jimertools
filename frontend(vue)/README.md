# Chat-Room
For a customer we maintain a decentralised application which includes chatting, storage and some kind of social media platform. Decentralised means (in this context), every user has his own (docker) container with his own files, a copy of each chat message send to each other and an instance of a node js application. When you send a message to another user in the UI, your container will communicate with the other persons container instead of a central database.

This is an advanced way for a chat application, therefore the knowledge of a 'normal' chat application is a good way to start. Below you'll find some requirements for a basic chat application. Completely free to do whatever unless specified. You can fork this into your own github or just create one or your own. Afterwards we'll look into it together.

Good luck and happy coding â˜•

## TODO: 
1. Build a single chat room with some kind of authentication
     - Frontend: VueJs => does not need to be styled
     - Backend: Nestjs => needs to be in memory and does not need to persist to a DB
     - Typescript!
2. Deploy this application to a server provided by the Jimber Team (optional)

## USER Stories
1. As a User, I want to be able to create a User 
     - Fill out a chat name
     - Unique
2. As a not logged-in User, I should not be able to see any messages
3. As a User, I want to be able to log in
     - It can be any kind of login (it should be decently secure, token or session)
4. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to log out
5. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to send messages in a chat room
     - The message should be a maximum of 255 characters
7. As a logged-in user, I want to receive and see messages in real-time.
